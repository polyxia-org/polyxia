**Polyxia** is a voice assistant project created by DevOps students at Polytech Montpellier that includes a FaaS architecture based on [Rik](https://github.com/rik-org/rik) and [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/). [Rik](https://github.com/rik-org/rik) is an experimental workload orchestrator that enables deployment of cloud applications written in Rust, providing a way to manage and schedule application instances. [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/), on the other hand, is an open-source project by AWS that allows for lightweight, microVM-based isolation of workloads, designed to be used with containers or serverless functions for an additional layer of security and isolation.

In addition, Polyxia features an NLU algorithm for detecting user intent from text generated through a speech-to-text algorithm that translates the user's voice command into text. This intent is then sent to the FaaS to schedule a function associated with the intent.

## Project Features

- NLU algorithm for intent detection from user text input
- Speech-to-text algorithm for converting user voice commands into text
- Scheduled function execution based on user intent
